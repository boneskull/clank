- skills/collaboration/executing-plans - Execute detailed plans in batches with review checkpoints. Use when have complete implementation plan to execute. When implementing in separate session from planning.

- skills/collaboration/remembering-conversations - Search previous Claude Code conversations for facts, patterns, decisions, and context using semantic or text search. Use when Jesse mentions "we discussed this before". When debugging similar issues. When looking for architectural decisions or code patterns from past work. Before reinventing solutions.

- skills/collaboration/dispatching-parallel-agents - Use multiple Claude agents to investigate and fix independent problems concurrently. Use when you have 3+ unrelated failures that can be debugged in parallel.
