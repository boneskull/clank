# Skills System - CLAUDE.md Reference

Copy this into your `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`:

```markdown
## Skills Library

You have a personal skills wiki at `~/.claude/skills/` with proven techniques, patterns, and tools that give you new capabilities.

**RIGHT NOW, go read:** `@~/.claude/skills/getting-started/SKILL.md`

**Before ANY task, run:** `~/.claude/skills/bin/skills-search PATTERN` to find relevant and helpful skills.

**Critical:** If a skill exists for your task, you MUST use it - even if you think you're already good at that. You're not. The skill prevents mistakes you don't know you make.

**Failure condition:** Skills exist and you didn't use them = failed task.
```

That's it. Keep it minimal - details are in getting-started.
