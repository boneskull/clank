# Meta Skills

Skills about skills - how to create and use the skills system.

## Available Skills

- @installing-skills/SKILL.md - Fork, clone, and symlink clank repo to ~/.claude/skills. Use for initial setup, installing clank for the first time.

- @creating-skills/SKILL.md - How to create effective skills for future Claude instances. Use when you discover a technique, pattern, or tool worth documenting for reuse.

- @testing-skills-with-subagents/SKILL.md - Iteratively test and bulletproof skills using pressure scenarios and rationalization analysis. Use after writing skills that enforce discipline or rules, before deploying skills agents might want to bypass.
